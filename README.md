# 487W-Semester-Project

A project made to solve the issues of Penn State Abington students being unable to see whether they have completed a minor or certificate before they have declared it.

To run, either run main.py through the base Python IDLE or through the command line.  An http link should appear in the output.
Paste that link into any website url, refresh the page and upload your Penn State student transcript.

If the user does not have Python installed on their computer, they will need to download it before running this.  To do that, simply go to the link below and download the latest version of Python there: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Library dependencies can be solved by opening cmd line before running the program for the first time and typing in the following commands:
pip install fitz
pip install PyMuPDF==1.19.0
pip install flask
